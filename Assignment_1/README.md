# Assignment 1

This is an assignment on linear regression. You will implement the basic linear model you saw in class, and you learn about regression with basis functions.

# Instructions:

2) The script in ``main_remp.py'' is not complete, so complete it please.
3) The final result you will get is two trained models.
4) Your results should show three figures. Make sure your script displays them (read about displaying matplotlib figure)
5) Do not forget to vary the value of N in the script (as instructed) and answer the question at the bottom of the script (write your answer as a comment below the quesstion)
